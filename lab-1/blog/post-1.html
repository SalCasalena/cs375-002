<h1>Overview of the American Bison</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>The American bison, also known as the buffalo, is an iconic species native to North America. Here are some key points about this remarkable animal:

Size and Appearance: Bison are the largest terrestrial animals in North America. Males can weigh up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) and stand about six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder1. Females are generally smaller, weighing around 900 pounds (400 kilograms).
Habitat and Range: Historically, bison roamed the Great Plains in vast herds, but their range extended from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Atlantic Seaboard to the Rocky Mountains2. Today, they are primarily found in conservation herds across the United States and Canada.
Conservation Status: Once numbering in the tens of millions, bison were nearly driven to extinction in the 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss3. Conservation efforts have helped their numbers recover, and there are now approximately 20,500 bison in conservation herds and 420,000 in commercial herds.
Ecological Role: Bison play a crucial role in their ecosystems by grazing on grasses, which helps maintain the health of the prairie. Their wallowing behavior creates microhabitats for other species.
Cultural Significance: Bison hold significant cultural importance for many Indigenous peoples in North America, who have relied on them for food, clothing, and tools for thousands of years3. In 2016, the American bison was designated the national mammal of the United States.</p>
