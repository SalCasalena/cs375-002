<h1>Bison in the news</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>A recent and fascinating story involves the birth of an incredibly rare white bison calf in Yellowstone National Park. This event, which occurred in June 2024, has excited Native American tribes who view it as a significant religious sign1. The white bison calf was spotted in the Lamar Valley area and is the first of its kind to be born in the last wild herd in the U.S. according to modern records.

The birth of a white bison is considered a sacred event by many Native tribes, including the Lakota people, who believe it heralds major change1. This calfâ€™s arrival has sparked celebrations and is seen as both a blessing and a warning, with tribes working to interpret its meaning.</p>
