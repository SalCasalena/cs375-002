<h1>Bison in Yellowstone</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>Yellowstone National Park is home to the largest and oldest public bison herd in the United States. Here are some key points about the bison in Yellowstone:

Population: The Yellowstone bison population fluctuates between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals1. As of 2024, the pre-calving population estimate is around 4,550 bison.
Habitat: These bison roam freely across the expansive landscape of Yellowstone and some nearby areas of Montana1. They can be seen year-round in places like the Hayden and Lamar valleys, and during the summer in grasslands.
Behavior: Yellowstone bison exhibit wild behaviors similar to their ancient ancestors. They congregate during the breeding season to compete for mates and migrate to find new habitats1.
Conservation: Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times1. The parkâ€™s bison were nearly driven to extinction in the 1800s but have since recovered thanks to conservation efforts.
Management: The National Park Service manages the bison population to maintain a sustainable number and to prevent conflicts with ranching and other activities outside the park. This includes coordinating with federal, state, and tribal partners.</p>
