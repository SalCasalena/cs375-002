<main>
<p>Largest Mammal in North America: Bison are the largest terrestrial animals in North America. Males can weigh up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) and stand about six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder1.
Speed and Agility: Despite their size, bison are quite agile. They can run up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) and jump over fences.
Diet: Bison are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses, weeds, and leafy plants. They can spend up to 11 hours a day foraging.
Lifespan: In the wild, bison typically live around 15 years, but they can live up to 25 years in captivity.
Historical Range: Bison once roamed from Alaska to Mexico and from the Atlantic Coast to the Rocky Mountains. Today, they are primarily found in conservation herds.
Conservation Success: Bison were nearly driven to extinction in the 19th century, but conservation efforts have helped their numbers recover. There are now approximately 20,500 bison in conservation herds and 420,000 in commercial herds.
Cultural Significance: Bison hold significant cultural importance for many Indigenous peoples in North America, providing food, clothing, and tools for thousands of years.
Behavior: Bison are social animals that live in herds. They exhibit complex behaviors, including wallowing in the dirt to deter insects and communicate with each other through grunts and snorts.
Reproduction: Bison calves, often called “red dogs” due to their orange-red color at birth, are typically born in late spring.
National Mammal: In 2016, the American bison was designated the national mammal of the United States.</p>
